    My name is Ton H Nguyen. I am currently a college student at Western Governors University, studying computer science. My journey into this field began when I lost my job at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
    With newfound free time, I envisioned creating a website to help people find open restaurants and shops. I also wanted to assist small businesses by developing a website for online orders and curbside pickup.

<p class="p-1 indent-4">
    Initially lacking coding skills, I dedicated myself to learning and now have experience with HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, Java, C++, Python, and SQL. With a solid foundation in computer science, 
    I am eager to apply my knowledge in a real-world setting. I am actively seeking an internship position to gain practical experience in the workplace.
